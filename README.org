** What's ~gene-tools~?

An interactive UI to query info of a gene in a given species.

+ Curated local data within this repo;
+ External databases via API.

** Supported species

** Usage
~M-x gene-tools~: choose organism, and then info to query, and then select gene name.

Note: currently only ~Saccharomyces cerevisiae~ - ~deletion collection~ is roughly implemented.

** Installation

1. Clone or download this repository (path of folder is ~<path-to-gene-tools>~ below).

2. In your ~.emacs~ file (or ~.doom.d/config.el~ if you are using Doom Emacs), add the following lines:
   #+begin_src elisp
