#+TITLE: Gene tools in Emacs

** What's ~gene-tools~?

An interactive UI to query info of a gene in a given species.

Info comes from:
+ Curated local data within this repo;
+ External databases via API.

** Supported species and actions
+ /Saccharomyces cerevisiae/
  + Deletion collection primers
  + GFP collection primers
  + Query SGD database (requires [[https://github.com/niwaka-ame/sgd-lookup.el][sgd-lookup.el]])

** Usage
~M-x gene-tools~: choose organism, and then choose info to query, and then select gene name.

** Installation

1. Clone or download this repository (path of folder is ~<path-to-gene-tools>~ below).

2. In your ~.emacs~ file (or ~.doom.d/config.el~ if you are using Doom Emacs), add the following lines:
   #+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-gene-tools>")
(require 'gene-tools)
   #+end_src

** Releases
+ Version 0.1.0: Functional for /Saccaromyces cerevisiae/.

** Known issues
+ The package loads relevant local data lazily, which may take a while if the local data file is large.
